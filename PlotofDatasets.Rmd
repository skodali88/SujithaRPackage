## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

## This is a Markdown in which user can generate Graphs from any Dataset

Loading default data - mtcars
'mtcars' is a data set that is a part of package 'ggplot2'
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
```

Before we use ggplot2, we need to install 'ggplot2' package using:
install.packages("ggplot2")


Create a scatter-plot of mpg vs. wt
```{r}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Miles per gallon vs. weight",
       x = "Weight (in thousands of pounds)",
       y = "Miles per gallon")
```
