Description: 
1) I have first introduced R and is basic functions in- 'BasicsOfR', 'BasicsOfPrinting',
   'BasicsOfArithmeticOperations','BasicsOfComparisonOperators','BasicsOfLogicalOperators',
   'BasicsOfLoops', 'BasicsOfStatisticalOperations', 
2) I have also included packages and data sets like 'mtcars' and its description
3) I have also included the importance and configuration of 'roxygen2' and 'devtools'
4) I have created a new unique function called 'calculate_averages' which not only calculates
   the average og any number of integers but also plots a graph for the same.
5) I have also created a new unique function called 'calculate_graph' which takes vector inputs
   for x-coordinates and y-coordinates and prints out a scatter plot
6) I have also created a markdown file which can convert a compatible data set into a plot.
