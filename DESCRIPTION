2) I have also included packages and data sets like 'mtcars' and its description
3) I have also included the importance and configuration of 'roxygen2' and 'devtools'
4) I have created a new unique function called 'calculate_averages' which not only calculates
   the average og any number of integers but also plots a graph for the same.

   for x-coordinates and y-coordinates and prints out a scatter plot
